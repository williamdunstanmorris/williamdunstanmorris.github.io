## about
Hey! I'm Will! 29, from England. I'm a musician and engineer, based in Kreuzberg, Berlin. At the moment, I work as a `DevOps Engineer` at [PEAT GmbH](https://plantix.net/en/), and have help build and maintain infrastructure and architecture across a host of services there. Originally, I grew up with a more audio-artsy-based background, but I got into engineering later on. I studied üéπ Music(BA) and `Computer Science`(MSc) at university. 

> Woah, winters are so cold in Berlin...

## current experience

As an engineer and Head of DevOps at PEAT (the only DevOps engineer actually), I work on the mission to help transform our engineering into a high-performance organisation, by being part of the discussions to prepare technical architecture, micro-services and engineering teams for future growth.

At Plantix, we help millions of small-scale farmers diagnose crop diseases using our machine learning algorithms and a single picture taken with their smart phones. Measurable social impact, indirect environment change and improving agricultural farming and sustainability not to mention an amazing bunch of workmates and friends were just some of the reasons I choose to work here at PEAT.

## previous experience

## selected project work

Here is a brief overview of a list of projects that I really enjoyed, as either part of my career or in my free time.

> If you already have [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max) and you want to try it, contact me. I haven't managed to properly package this project up yet. But I will get around to it. You can try and `git clone` it and see if you can get it working in Max/MSP yourself as some running modules.

**Developer: SuperCollider VST**
* 


## talks and demonstrations

Before the pandemic, I made the most of my opportunities to give talks and demo on a series of topics. Below are some nice summaries of things I spoke about. 

**2018, Continuous Integration Practices**
Rising from my project work on developing a CI pipeline for a C++ framework using CMake, I gave a
live coding tutorial reflecting on continuous integration, notably on how it could be combined with
more computer intensive research. This was an independent initiative that addressed a gap in a
trending technology and led to interest from a broad range of participants.

**2018, ‚ÄúGit Poetry‚Äù**
To better my collegues‚Äô understanding of version-control techniques, I gave a live git demonstration
on good practices for version control for collaborative workflow. As a result, I feel more confident
about pushing changes within a collabo- rative environment. This is summarised in my blog post,
https://williamdunstanmorris.github.io//gitflow-techniques.html

**2018, CVSSP 30th Anniversary - [Can Machines Think?](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing/about/30th-anniversary)** Demoed 3D binaural audio software for a few days as part of the anniversary event for the CVSSP University of Surrey research department. 
You can see the program for this [here](https://indd.adobe.com/view/12e222f7-79ab-4921-9c15-6ac26cbd267d). 

**2020, Observability for Web Services**

## languages

* I prefer the Macbook trackpads and screen resolution, but I spend a lot of time on Linux. So I use both.
* I got into programming through [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)
* I prefer [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) over fish.
* I really love [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). I've written tonnes of it to provision resources in AWS. It has made AWS so much less overwhelming.
* Written small scripts and sysops tasks with Python
* Written and collaborated on software with C++ and Java
* I'm learning [Golang](https://go.dev/)! Specifically, microservices with Golang. I've found it hard to find a language that I really liked, but I think that this is the language I really want to master eventually.
* I tried some wordpress development with PHP for Wordpress too. That was actually pretty fun. OO is nice.

[S3A](https://www.s3a-spatialaudio.org/) was a five-year UK research collaboration between internationally leading experts in 3D audio and visual processing at the Universities of Surrey, Salford and Southampton and BBC R&D. The partnership aimed to unlock the creative potential of 3D sound to provide immersive experiences to the general public at home or on the move. S3A pioneered a radical new listener centred approach to 3D sound production that can dynamically adapt to the listeners‚Äô environment and location to create a sense of immersion. Current 3D sound systems rely upon fixed loudspeaker arrangements and acoustically treated rooms that are not practical for home use. S3A changed the way audio is produced and delivered to enable practical high-quality 3D sound reproduction based on listener perception.



The 5-year, [S3A](https://www.s3a-spatialaudio.org/) project I was involved collaborations between 3 universities and the BBC R&D. Involved with the Development integration of research for spatial-audio, for object-based audio. Developed cross-platform applications with C++, and lead in software deployment and continuous integration I hold an MSc in Computer Science at the University of York, and a BA in Music from the University of Sussex. ## Relevant Projects ### Miyagi-Studio Framework **Language/Technology: PHP & Wordpress** Developing a multi-purpose theme for Wordpress, using Redux, a backend PHP framework, targeted at website designers to give more dashboard controls over the website look-and-feel by embedding more creative open-source technologies, like WebGL. Utilised a version-controlled source and build structure with gulp, Node.js and yarn for deployment and packaging on a local server, embedded within Wordpress. This was a self-driven project. ### Continuous Integration and Deployment Lead for VST3 Production Suite **Language/Technology: Git, Gitlab CI** In order to have versioned VST3 software working on multiple platforms and for various digital-audio-workstations, I engineered a Gitlab-CI pipeline focusing on hidden keys and anchors to reduce code redundancy. ### Deployment & Continuous Integration Engineering for VISR **Language/Technology: Git, Gitlab CI** To achieve versioned cross-platform releases of the [VISR](http://www.s3a-spatialaudio.org/visr) framework, an object-based audio rendering framework for the open-source community, I worked with the University of Southampton remotely to craft an automated pipeline with Gitlab-CI, from building in CMake, Unit testing through to packaging. ### Software Developer on Spatial Audio Software **Language/Technology: Max/MSP, C++ and JUCE** In order to produce software for object-based audio, we utilised an ecosystem with JUCE framework and our object-based audio rendering framework. I Engineered and integrated research that lead to the implementation of a VST software that allows audio ‚Äòobjects‚Äô to be panned for multiple speaker setups within digital audio workstations. Tested with up to 42 speakers. Much of the code will be openly available on GitHub for open-source-community. ### Kluster, A Max/MSP framework for OpenGL **Language/Technology: Max/MSP; GLSL** Self-lead MSc project to create a number of abstracted extendable modules that give more user-friendly control over the way audiovisuals are rendered in real-time. ## Demonstrations ### Git for Poets To better the centre's understanding of version-control techniques, I gave a live git demonstration on good practices for version control for collaborative workflow. This is summarised in a blog post here, https://williamdunstanmorris.github.io//gitflow-techniques.html ### Continuous Integration Practices As part of two-part demonstration series, I gave live demonstration with gitlab-runner for gitlab-ci, explaining the benefits of automating a build process. ### Object-Based Reverberation Demo As part of the S3A project's auditing process, I curated a demo of my audio software within a 9.1 speaker setup to some visiting external members from Sennheiser. ### Optimising Workflow Practices with grid-computing. In an upcoming demonstration, I will be explaining gitlab-ci integration with high throughput computing software, HTCondor, for faster workflow approaches in fields involving machine-learning and DNNs.

At Plantix, we help millions of small-scale farmers diagnose crop diseases using our machine learning algorithms and a single picture taken with their smart phones. Measurable social impact, indirect environment change and improving agricultural farming and sustainability not to mention an amazing bunch of workmates and friends were just some of the reasons I choose to work here at PEAT.

As an engineer and Head of DevOps at PEAT, I work on the mission to help transform our engineering into a high-performance organisation, by being part of the discussions to prepare technical architecture, micro-services and engineering teams for future growth.

============

Project experience & stories:

Worked within technical debt and bad design decisions to slowly recreate services through ground-up documented design.

Bastion and security first
Least privilege rule

I deployed, maintained and own an entire on-premise CI server (TeamCity). I used Terraform to create additional VM agents, and Ansible to provision them with the frameworks like correct Android SDK, and docker-compose to support pipeline portability across multiple agents. Docker was great for this, and it meant that we continuously create a stable and efficient delivery pipelines that ensure both high performance and portability, especially during SEV-1 incident hot-fixes.

I worked with the backend team to help craft the terraform for their django-python api, hosted as a stateless application on AWS ECS. This included with it, a service worker and scheduler architecture, running under within the same cluster. They also needed to integrate similar components, like statsd and flower too.

I worked closely with PEAT's Android Team, the developers behind the Plantix App - to help craft two pipelines using mainly Gradle for both building and testing, and release track delivery on the Google Play Store. We even made a nightly build for or develop branch, which helped QA test upcoming features in the morning.

I was trying to figure out how we can be more sustainable in the cloud and less wasteful. Idle resource usage is the worst. I used ansible as a control point to calling the aws api to shutting instances and agents down when our teams weren't using them. It was great way to shut servers down at night. I actually made this into a mini TeamCity pipeline job and gave developers control over it. If they needed to work at night, they could just boot up the agent servers as they needed.

I also migrated all our old projects off from Jenkins and put them onto TeamCity, improving them by dockerising more or less all the pipelines so they can be more portable on different agent runner VMs if they need to be.

I got really into operational metrics, especially with our onprem grafana. Because we had around 45 EC2 VMs that served development, production or internal purposes, we needed some basic observability. However, with so many VMs, this was far too laborious and prone to human error to do. So, I backwards wrote a grafana dashboard panel from json and converted it to jsonnet to make abstractions and create a standard of alert responses and thresholds that could be adjusted without manually having to fiddle with Grafana all the time.

I worked as the platform lead and cloud engineer on our business-focused API. The API was focused on providing communication channels (like WhatsApp, SMS) between retailers and farmers throughout India. The API was integrated into Plantix, our Android-based app for Farmers. I really liked using AWS Code Deploy for this. We configured it to be Green/Blue, and it meant that we could fail fast without impacting farmers with outage. CodeDeploy acted like a controller between AWS ECS and potential registered targets from the AWS application load balancer. I would definitely utilise these exact technologies again for a versioned API.

I wanted to graph more low level application based metrics from our API. I worked on creating a custom Grafana/Prometheus stated client integration for AWS ECS. This worked like a sidecar, and was valuable because you can observe the behaviour of an application in a very lightweight manner - using a lightweight statsd UDP protocol method. Sometimes it went wrong, but the great thing about UDP is that you can design it to fail and not cause outage. Losing observability is not as bad as losing our application.

I worked on creating documentation for standardisation of convenience in the cloud via accounts, logging, metrics and naming conventions across AWS. It was not the most exciting project, but extremely useful for ensuring collective responsibility for operational excellence across multiple teams.

I worked hard on completely removing annoying nginx and apache technologies. They are error prone and are difficult to test. They have caused a lot of downtime and config bugs for me in the past. Actually, for a static website with a lot of prerendered content, you can just serve it with a content delivery network like AWS CloudFront. Once you've configured certificates and S3 origins, you can figure out S3 object metadata for client response headers, including for compression. The tricky part here to learn more about is understanding how to deliver and update content for clients too; something that's possible via object versionsing and cache invalidation.

Creating maintenance windows for internal services - services that could afford downtime - was something that was difficult to maintain, but

## Where do I want to be in 5 years?

The same place I am now, just a little older, and a little wiser. A better cook, a better programmer and a better pianist. I guess I want to be pretty smart in one programming language now that I've spent a lot of time in operations and the cloud. I feel like I really know how to host, maintain and deploy a project with some tricks up my sleeve. I just need to transition more into building the code for one now. Time will tell, I guess.


Creative and affable Engineer, I can help you build your IT infrastructure from the ground up, provide insight on operations architecture or advise your business on how you can move into the cloud. I come from a commercial background hands-on experience working in Linux/Unix environments, supporting, automating, and optimising development and deployments in software, leveraging configuration management for CI/CD. Hold an MSc in Computer Science from the University of York.

Creative and affable engineer and developer, working with 3D audio applications and space. Love
platform engineering, contributions to complex research topics in audio, setting up software
infrastructure, hooking up multi-speaker arrays/gear and producing. I look for team environments
with a young diverse culture. I grew up with audio production and music, and now combine that
with my engineering skillset. I work in moulding these two things together.
